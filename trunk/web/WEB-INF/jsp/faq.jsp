		<td colspan="2">Reviewing and scoring a recording's quality is
		subjective, meaning everyone has their own personal tastes, likes and
		dislikes. That's what makes your input so important and interesting.
		However, so that people have a common reference from which to base
		their reviews on, and so that others' reviews can be easily
		interpreted, here is a general suggested rating scale. Remember you
		are rating the recording itself, not the concert that you remember
		if/when you attended.</td>
